Understand how a page is loaded for the user by analysing which parts of the page loads faster and which don't by recording screenshots during load.

## Try

1. Open Network panel in Dev Tools
2. Click on the `settings` icon on the top right, inside of the Network tab
3. Enable `Capture screenshots` option
4. Reload the page

Chrome will start recording the screenshots at some intervals from starting of page load to completion. Double-click on them to see what elements appear on screen faster and what doesn't.
