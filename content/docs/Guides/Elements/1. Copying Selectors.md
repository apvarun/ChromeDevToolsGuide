# Copying Selectors

Do you know that Chrome provides you with element selectors?

Next time, you don't have to figure it out on your own 😁. Try out yourself to select the below button and text.

{{< button class="doNothing" >}}Sample Button{{< /button >}}

<br />
<div id="container" class="center-text">
  <span class="inner-text">What is my selector?</span>
</div>
