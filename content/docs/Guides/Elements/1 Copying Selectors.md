Do you know that Chrome provides you with element selectors?

Next time, you don't have to figure it out on your own 😁.

## Try

1. Open Elements panel in Dev Tools
2. Right-click on the node for the button or text below it to get it's selector
3. Choose `Copy -> Copy Selector`

The CSS selector for that element will be copied to your clipboard.

{{< button class="doNothing" >}}Sample Button{{< /button >}}

<div id="container" class="center-text">
  <span class="inner-text">What is my selector?</span>
</div>
