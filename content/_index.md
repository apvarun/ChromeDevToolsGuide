### What

This guide is a collection of walk-throughs for learning to use developer tools in the browser.

### Why

Day-to-day, I come across a lot of developers who need help in solving issues on the web. And most of the time, I end up using some of the dev tools functionality to debug and solve the problem. This made me realize that there are actually people out there who could get help in learning to use dev tools and hence this website.

### How to use

Each of the topics in the menu is for a feature in dev tools. This website tries to have an example that anyone can `inspect` to try out the feature in their dev tools.
